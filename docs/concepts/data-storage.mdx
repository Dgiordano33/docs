## What is Data?

Data in Checkly encompasses all the information that flows through your monitoring systemâ€”from configuration data and environment variables to runtime data and results. Multiple API checks can target the same server/service. In this case, your checks might need the same configuration item like an authentication token, a specific user name or even just some specific part of the URL. You can use variables to 'DRY' up your checks and store these variables in just one place.

Think of Data as the lifeblood of your monitoring system. It includes everything from the configuration that defines how your Checks behave, to the environment-specific parameters that adapt them to different contexts, to the results and metrics that tell you how your applications are performing.

Data in Checkly is designed to be dynamic, secure, and context-aware. It can be shared across multiple Checks, scoped to specific environments, and automatically injected into your monitoring logic at runtime.

## Types of Data

There are two types of environment variables (env vars) in the Checkly CLI context:

1. **Local environment variables** - exist in your development environment and CI/CD pipeline. Use local environment variables to replace values in your constructs before test and deploy invocations.

2. **Remote environment variables** - are stored in your Checkly account. Use remote environment variables to dynamically inject or replace values during runtime of a check.

## Data Hierarchy and Merging

As checks are scheduled, Checkly merges the check, group and global environment variables into one data set and exposes them to the runtime environment. During merging, any check variable with the same name as a global or group variable overrides that variable.

This hierarchical approach means you can define default values at the global level, override them at the group level for specific applications or teams, and further customize them at the individual Check level when needed. It provides both consistency and flexibility in how you manage configuration data.

## Data as Configuration Strategy

Data management in Checkly enables sophisticated configuration strategies that adapt to different environments, teams, and use cases. You can maintain separate data sets for development, staging, and production while using the same monitoring logic across all environments. This approach ensures consistency while accommodating the necessary differences between deployment contexts.
