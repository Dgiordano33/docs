Check Results are the outcomes of every monitoring test that Checkly runs. You can select any check on the main Checkly dashboard to get an overview of the results they have produced so far. Select a check and you will see a breakdown of its recent runs, together with key availability and performance metrics. 

## What are Results?
Think of Results as the digital paper trail that tells the story of your application's health over time. Each time a Check executes—whether it's testing an API endpoint, clicking through a user flow, or verifying a service connection—it generates a Result that captures everything that happened during that test run.

Results are more than just pass or fail indicators. They're comprehensive records that include performance metrics, error details, screenshots, network traces, and any other telemetry that helps you understand not just whether something worked, but how well it worked and why it might have failed.

## Understanding Result Data
The monitoring results chart shows a summary of the run results in the selected time period where each bar represents a part of that time period. You can change the time period in the summary section. Hovering a bar in the chart will show the results of all check runs executed during that time.

We keep raw results for 30 days. After 30 days they are erased. However, we keep the rolled up results for an indefinite period. This means you have detailed debugging information for recent issues while maintaining long-term trends and historical performance data.

## Types of Result Information
Different types of Checks generate different kinds of Result data. API check results will expose key performance and correctness data about the HTTP response received from the target endpoint. Browser Check Results include screenshots, performance metrics, and detailed execution traces. Heartbeat check results show information about the ping request, like when it was received and its source.

For each test session, we record all logging, videos, traces, screenshots and other telemetry. This is especially powerful when using our @playwright/test powered browser checks.

## Results as Historical Intelligence
Results transform your monitoring from reactive to proactive by building a comprehensive knowledge base about your application's behavior patterns. They help you identify trends, correlate incidents across different parts of your system, and understand the impact of deployments or infrastructure changes on user experience.

The real power of Results lies in their aggregation—individual results tell you what happened at a specific moment, but the collection of Results over time reveals the deeper story of your application's reliability, performance trends, and the effectiveness of your monitoring strategy.
