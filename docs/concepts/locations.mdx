Locations represent the global vantage points from which Checkly monitors your applications. You can configure your run checks to run from an ever growing amount of global locations. Leveraging global infrastructure allows us to measure what the user experience is in different parts of the world.

## What are Locations?
Think of Locations as your monitoring outposts distributed around the globe. Each Location represents a geographic point where Checkly can execute your Checks, simulating the experience of users in that region. This geographic distribution is crucial because it reveals how your application performs for users regardless of where they're accessing it from.

You can select one or more data center locations to run your checks from. We advise to always select at least 2 locations. There are two reasons for this: Redundancy: we might have an issue in one location, but not the other. Retrying: if your check fails, we will execute its retry strategy where you have the option check from a different location. 


## Public Locations

You can configure your run checks to run from an ever growing amount of global locations. Leveraging global infrastructure allows us to measure what the user experience is in different parts of the world.

We use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) to host our check runner infrastructure and follow the opening of new datacenter locations as close a possible, i.e. if  a new location opens up, Checkly will be there very soon.

Current locations in Checkly are

## Private Locations

Private Locations extend this concept to your own infrastructure. A Private Location is a monitoring location that you manage by simply deploying a lightweight Checkly Agent. Running a check from a Private Location allows you to monitor internal systems and test the performance and reliability of applications and APIs that are only accessible from within your network.

## Scheduling strategies

Checkly provides two scheduling strategies for running checks: Round-robin or Parallel scheduling. To select a scheduling strategy go to ‘Scheduling and locations’ when creating or editing a check.

### Round-robin

Using round-robin, your check will run on one of the selected locations each time it is scheduled. The next check run will be scheduled on a different location from the list until all locations have been run once, and the check rotates back to the first location in the list.

When using the round-robin strategy you can choose to have retries to run from a random location of the ones selected, or run it from the same location as the first attempt

Use round-robin when the service you are monitoring can be considered available as long as at least one location is available and detecting a regional outage is not critical.

### Parallel

With parallel scheduling, each time the check is scheduled it will run once from each selected location. When running a check in parallel, retries will always be run from the same location as the first attempt.

Use parallel scheduling to reduce detection times for regional outages and reduce time to detect service degradations that impact the customer experience.

## Locations as User Experience Proxies
Ultimately, Locations are about empathy for your users. They ensure that your monitoring perspective matches your users' reality. A user in Tokyo may have a vastly different experience than someone in New York, and Locations help you understand and optimize for these differences. They transform monitoring from a single-perspective activity into a truly global understanding of application performance and reliability.
