## Overview

Checkly is a comprehensive monitoring-as-code platform that enables teams to monitor their web applications, APIs, and user journeys through synthetic monitoring, uptime checks, and performance testing. Built for modern development workflows, Checkly integrates directly into your CI/CD pipeline, allowing you to catch issues before they reach production.

The platform combines three core monitoring capabilities: **Detect** for proactive monitoring through synthetic tests and uptime checks, **Communicate** for intelligent alerting and status pages, and **Resolve** for deep observability with distributed tracing and AI-powered incident analysis.

## Differentiators

**Monitoring-as-Code Philosophy**: Unlike traditional monitoring tools, Checkly treats monitoring as code, allowing you to version control, review, and deploy your monitoring alongside your application code using popular frameworks like Playwright and Puppeteer.

**Developer-First Experience**: Built by developers for developers, Checkly offers a CLI-first approach with seamless integration into existing development workflows, making monitoring setup as natural as writing tests.

**AI-Powered Insights**: Rocky AI provides intelligent incident analysis and automated root cause identification, reducing mean time to resolution and eliminating alert fatigue.

**End-to-End Coverage**: From synthetic monitoring and API checks to real user monitoring and distributed tracing, Checkly provides complete visibility across your entire application stack.

**Global Infrastructure**: With monitoring locations worldwide and private location support, Checkly ensures your applications perform well for users regardless of their geographic location.

## Use Cases

**Pre-Production Testing**: Validate application functionality and performance in staging environments before deployment, catching regressions early in the development cycle.

**Production Monitoring**: Continuously monitor critical user journeys, API endpoints, and application performance to ensure optimal user experience.

**E-commerce Monitoring**: Monitor checkout flows, payment processing, and product catalog functionality to prevent revenue loss from broken user paths.

**API Reliability**: Ensure third-party integrations and internal APIs maintain expected response times and availability through automated testing.

**Multi-Environment Validation**: Test applications across different environments, browsers, and devices to ensure consistent functionality and performance.

**Compliance and SLA Monitoring**: Track uptime and performance metrics to meet service level agreements and regulatory compliance requirements.

## Checkly Is Best Fit For

**Engineering Teams** who want to shift monitoring left and treat monitoring as an integral part of their development process rather than an afterthought.

**DevOps and SRE Teams** looking for programmable monitoring that integrates seamlessly with their existing infrastructure-as-code and GitOps workflows.

**Product Teams** who need to ensure critical user journeys work flawlessly across different environments and want real-time visibility into user experience.

**Growing Startups** that need enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities without the complexity of traditional monitoring solutions.

**Enterprise Organizations** requiring scalable monitoring with advanced features like private locations, SSO integration, and comprehensive audit trails.

**Teams Using Modern Web Technologies** who want monitoring that understands modern JavaScript frameworks, SPAs, and API-first architectures.
