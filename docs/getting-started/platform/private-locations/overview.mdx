# Private Locations

Private Locations enable you to run Checkly monitoring from within your own infrastructure. By deploying a lightweight Checkly Agent, you can monitor internal systems, test from specific geographic locations, and maintain complete control over your monitoring environment.

<Note>
Private Locations require **Owner** or **Admin** permissions to create and manage.
</Note>

## What are Private Locations?

A Private Location is a custom monitoring location that you control by deploying Checkly Agent containers in your infrastructure. These agents connect securely to Checkly and execute your checks from within your network environment.

## Key Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Network-Level Access">
Private Locations run inside your network perimeter, giving you access to:
- Internal APIs and services not exposed to the internet
- Development and staging environments
- Database connections and internal tools
- Services behind VPNs or private networks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Geographic Flexibility">
Deploy agents anywhere to get location-specific insights:
- Test from regions not covered by Checkly's global network
- Monitor from your actual data center locations
- Validate performance from specific customer regions
- Meet regulatory requirements for local testing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security and Compliance">
Maintain complete control over your monitoring environment:
- Keep sensitive data within your network
- Meet compliance requirements for data residency
- Maintain audit trails within your infrastructure
- Use your existing security policies and controls
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scalable and Resilient">
Design for production workloads:
- Horizontal scaling with multiple agents
- Automatic load distribution across agents
- Graceful handling of agent failures
- Zero-downtime updates and maintenance
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Private Locations Work

The process is straightforward and secure:

1. **Create a Private Location** in your Checkly account
2. **Deploy Checkly Agents** using the provided API key
3. **Configure your checks** to use your Private Location
4. **Monitor results** just like any other Checkly check

## Requirements

Before setting up Private Locations, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Infrastructure Requirements" icon="server">
- Container runtime (Docker, Podman, or similar)
- Outbound HTTPS access to `agent.checklyhq.com`
- Network access to your target applications
- Sufficient CPU and memory resources
</Card>

<Card title="Access Requirements" icon="key">
- Checkly account with Owner or Admin role
- Ability to deploy containers in your infrastructure
- Network configuration permissions
- Optional: HTTP proxy configuration capability
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Resource Requirements

<Info>
**Memory Guidelines:**
- API checks: ~150MB per concurrent check
- Browser checks: ~1.5GB per concurrent check
- Minimum recommended: 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM for mixed workloads
</Info>

## Getting Started

</Card>

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Agent Status Monitoring

Checkly monitors agent connectivity and health:

- **Active**: Agent is connected and processing checks
- **Unavailable**: No agents connected for 10+ minutes
- **Degraded**: Some agents disconnected, reduced capacity

When a Private Location becomes unavailable, Checkly automatically:
- Stops scheduling new checks for that location
- Emails account owners and admins
- Resumes scheduling when agents reconnect

### Load Distribution

Multiple agents in the same Private Location automatically:
- Share check execution load
- Provide redundancy and high availability
- Handle graceful failover during agent restarts
- Requeue checks from failed agents (300-second timeout)
