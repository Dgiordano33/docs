# Private Locations

Private Locations enable you to run Checkly monitoring from within your own infrastructure. By deploying a lightweight Checkly Agent, you can monitor internal systems, test from specific geographic locations, and maintain complete control over your monitoring environment.

<Note>
Private Locations require **Owner** or **Admin** permissions to create and manage.
</Note>

## What are Private Locations?

A Private Location is a custom monitoring location that you control by deploying Checkly Agent containers in your infrastructure. These agents connect securely to Checkly and execute your checks from within your network environment.

- Meet regulatory requirements for local testing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security and Compliance">
Maintain complete control over your monitoring environment:
- Keep sensitive data within your network

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How Private Locations Work

The process is straightforward and secure:

1. **Create a Private Location** in your Checkly account
2. **Deploy Checkly Agents** using the provided API key
3. **Configure your checks** to use your Private Location
4. **Monitor results** just like any other Checkly check

## Requirements

Before setting up Private Locations, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Infrastructure Requirements" icon="server">
- Container runtime (Docker, Podman, or similar)
- Outbound HTTPS access to `agent.checklyhq.com`
- Network access to your target applications
- Sufficient CPU and memory resources
</Card>

<Card title="Access Requirements" icon="key">
- Checkly account with Owner or Admin role
- Ability to deploy containers in your infrastructure
- Network configuration permissions
- Optional: HTTP proxy configuration capability
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Resource Requirements

<Info>
**Memory Guidelines:**
- API checks: ~150MB per concurrent check
- Browser checks: ~1.5GB per concurrent check
- Minimum recommended: 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM for mixed workloads
</Info>

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Private Location

Navigate to [Private Locations](https://app.checklyhq.com/private-locations) and click "New private location":

![Create a new private location with name and icon](/images/private-locations/pl_started_2.png)

Provide a descriptive name and choose an icon that represents your location or environment.

### Step 2: Secure Your API Key

Copy and securely store the generated API key. This key authenticates your agents with Checkly:

![Copy and securely store your Private Location API key](/images/private-locations/pl_started_3.png)

<Warning>
The API key is only shown once during creation. Store it securely in your secrets management system.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Deploy Your First Agent

Start a Checkly Agent using Docker:

```bash
docker run -e API_KEY="pl_your_api_key_here" -d checkly/agent:latest
```

For production deployments, consider:
- Using specific version tags instead of `latest`
- Configuring resource limits and restart policies
- Setting up monitoring and logging for the agent containers

### Step 4: Verify Agent Connection

Refresh your Private Locations page to see your active agents:

![Verify that your Checkly Agent is connected and running](/images/private-locations/pl_started_4.png)

The interface shows:
- Number of active agents
- Last connection time
- Agent health status

### Step 5: Configure Your Checks

When creating checks, select your Private Location from the available locations:

![Select your Private Location when creating or editing checks](/images/private-locations/pl_started_5.png)

Deselect other locations to ensure your checks run exclusively from your Private Location.

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Agent Status Monitoring

Checkly monitors agent connectivity and health:

- **Active**: Agent is connected and processing checks
- **Unavailable**: No agents connected for 10+ minutes
- **Degraded**: Some agents disconnected, reduced capacity

When a Private Location becomes unavailable, Checkly automatically:
- Stops scheduling new checks for that location
- Emails account owners and admins
- Resumes scheduling when agents reconnect

### Load Distribution

Multiple agents in the same Private Location automatically:
- Share check execution load
- Provide redundancy and high availability
- Handle graceful failover during agent restarts
- Requeue checks from failed agents (300-second timeout)

## Integration with Checkly CLI

Define Private Locations in your monitoring-as-code workflow:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { ApiCheck, BrowserCheck } from 'checkly/constructs'

// API check using private location
new ApiCheck('internal-api-check', {
  name: 'Internal API Health',
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'http://internal-api.company.local/health'
  },
  privateLocations: ['company-datacenter-east'],
  maxResponseTime: 5000
})

// Browser check using private location  
new BrowserCheck('internal-app-check', {
  name: 'Internal App Login Flow',
  code: {
    entrypoint: './internal-app.spec.ts'
  },
  privateLocations: ['company-datacenter-east']
})
```

```javascript JavaScript
const { ApiCheck, BrowserCheck } = require('checkly/constructs')

// API check for internal service
new ApiCheck('database-health-check', {
  name: 'Database Connection Health',
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'http://db-proxy.internal:8080/health'
  },
  privateLocations: ['internal-network'],
  assertions: [
    { source: 'STATUS_CODE', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: 200 }
  ]
})
```
</CodeGroup>
