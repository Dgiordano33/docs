Checkly's Detect platform provides comprehensive monitoring and testing capabilities to ensure your applications deliver exceptional user experiences. By combining proactive monitoring with detailed testing, Detect helps you identify issues before they impact your users.

## What is Detect?

Detect is Checkly's monitoring and testing engine that validates your applications across multiple dimensions:

- **Proactive monitoring**: Catch issues before they affect users
- **Multi-layered validation**: From infrastructure to user experience
- **Global perspective**: Monitor from locations worldwide
- **Real-time insights**: Immediate feedback on system health

## Core Capabilities

### Testing
Create and execute automated tests that validate your application's functionality. Test API endpoints, user workflows, and complex business processes to ensure everything works as expected.

**Key features:**
- API endpoint validation
- Browser-based user journey testing
- Multi-step workflow verification
- Environment variable management
- Test result analysis and reporting

### Uptime Monitoring
Track your application's availability and performance with continuous monitoring. Get immediate alerts when issues occur and maintain high service levels for your users.

**Monitor types:**
- **URL Monitors**: Check HTTP endpoints and web pages
- **Heartbeat Monitors**: Validate service availability through pings
- **TCP Monitors**: Monitor network connectivity and port availability

### Synthetic Monitoring
Go beyond simple uptime checks with realistic user simulations. Validate complete business workflows and user experiences before your customers encounter issues.

**Check types:**
- **API Checks**: Monitor individual endpoints with detailed validation
- **Browser Checks**: Automate real user interactions using Playwright
- **Multistep Checks**: Test complex workflows with sequential API requests

## Monitoring Strategy

### Layered Approach
Implement comprehensive monitoring across multiple layers:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Monitor servers, databases, and network connectivity
2. **Service Layer**: Validate API endpoints and microservice communication  
3. **Application Layer**: Test business logic and data processing workflows
4. **User Experience Layer**: Verify complete user journeys and interactions

### Global Coverage
Monitor from multiple geographic locations to ensure consistent global performance:
- **Americas**: US East/West, Canada, Brazil
- **Europe**: Ireland, London, Frankfurt, Stockholm
- **Asia Pacific**: Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Mumbai
- **Private Locations**: Deploy agents in your own infrastructure
