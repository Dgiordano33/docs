# Testing

Welcome to the Testing section of Checkly's platform. Here you'll learn how to create, configure, and manage various types of tests to ensure your applications are working correctly.

## Overview

Testing is a core component of Checkly's monitoring platform. It allows you to:

- Create synthetic tests that simulate user interactions
- Set up API tests to verify endpoints
- Configure browser-based tests for complex user flows
- Schedule and automate test execution

## Getting Started

To create your first test:

1. Navigate to the Tests section in your Checkly dashboard
2. Click "Create Test"
3. Choose your test type (API, Browser, or Multi-step)
4. Configure your test parameters
5. Set up your monitoring schedule

## Test Types

### API Tests
Simple HTTP requests to verify your API endpoints are responding correctly.

### Browser Tests
Full browser automation to test complex user interactions and workflows.

### Multi-step Tests
Advanced tests that combine multiple API calls and browser actions.
