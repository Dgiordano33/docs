# Uptime Monitoring

Uptime monitoring is essential for ensuring your applications are always available to your users. Checkly provides comprehensive uptime monitoring capabilities to help you track and maintain your application's reliability.

## What is Uptime Monitoring?

Uptime monitoring continuously checks if your applications and services are accessible and responding correctly. It helps you:

- Detect outages and performance issues quickly
- Track your application's availability over time
- Receive immediate alerts when problems occur
- Maintain high service levels for your users

## Key Features

### Global Monitoring
Monitor your applications from multiple locations worldwide to ensure they're accessible from anywhere your users are located.

### Response Time Tracking
Track how quickly your applications respond, helping you identify performance degradation before it becomes a problem.

### Status Code Monitoring
Ensure your applications return the correct HTTP status codes and handle errors appropriately.

### SSL Certificate Monitoring
Automatically monitor SSL certificate expiration and validity to prevent security issues.

## Setting Up Uptime Monitoring

1. **Create a Check**: Set up your first uptime check in the Checkly dashboard
2. **Configure Locations**: Choose monitoring locations that match your user base
3. **Set Thresholds**: Define acceptable response times and status codes
4. **Configure Alerts**: Set up notifications for when issues are detected
5. **Monitor Results**: Track your uptime metrics and performance over time

## Uptime Metrics

- **Uptime Percentage**: The percentage of time your application is available
- **Response Time**: How quickly your application responds to requests
- **Status Codes**: The HTTP status codes returned by your application
- **Error Rates**: The frequency of errors and failures

## Best Practices

- Monitor from multiple geographic locations
- Set realistic response time thresholds
- Configure appropriate alerting rules
- Regularly review and update your monitoring setup
- Use synthetic monitoring alongside uptime monitoring
