Use URL monitors to track the availability of your HTTP-based services. They send a GET request to a specified URL and check for a successful response and acceptable response time.

Typical use cases include:

* Ensuring your marketing site returns a 200 OK
* Verifying your documentation site loads quickly
* Checking that your SSL certificate is still valid
* Confirming that a public pricing endpoint is reachable for customers

URL monitors are ideal for lightweight uptime monitoring. If a URL goes down, returns an unexpected status code, or responds too slowly, any configured [alerts](/docs/alerting-and-retries/) will be triggered.
