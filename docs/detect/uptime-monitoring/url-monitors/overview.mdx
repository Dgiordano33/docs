Use URL monitors to track the availability of your HTTP-based services. They send a GET request to a specified URL and check for a successful response and acceptable response time.

Typical use cases include:

* Ensuring your marketing site returns a 200 OK
* Verifying your documentation site loads quickly
* Checking that your SSL certificate is still valid
* Confirming that a public pricing endpoint is reachable for customers

URL monitors are ideal for lightweight uptime monitoring. If a URL goes down, returns an unexpected status code, or responds too slowly, any configured [alerts](/docs/alerting-and-retries/) will be triggered.

## Creating a URL monitor

Each URL monitor is defined by its request configuration, which includes the target URL and how its availability and performance should be validated.

* **Request method:** Always `GET`.
* **URL:** The HTTP(S) URL to monitor (e.g. `https://api.example.com`).
* **IP family:** Defaults to IPv4.

To validate the response further, you can configure:

* **Response time limits:** Define latency thresholds for degraded or failed states.
* **Assertions:** Validate the returned response status code (e.g. expect `200`).

Additional settings for URL monitors include:

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts.
* **Tags:** Use tags to organize monitors across dashboards and [maintenance windows](/docs/maintenance-windows/).
* **Scheduling:** Set how frequently the monitor runs and choose execution strategies. See [scheduling configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/scheduling).
* **Locations:** Select optimal monitoring locations for global coverage. See [monitoring locations](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/locations).
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. See [retry strategies](/docs/alerting-and-retries/retries/).
* **Alerting:** Configure comprehensive alerting and notification rules. See [alerting configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/alerting).

## CLI Configuration

With the [Checkly CLI](/docs/cli/), you can define URL monitors in TypeScript or JavaScript and manage them as code. See [CLI configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/cli-configuration) for comprehensive examples and advanced patterns.
