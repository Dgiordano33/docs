This guide walks you through creating your first URL monitor to check the availability and performance of your websites, APIs, or any HTTP-based service.

## Before You Start

URL monitors are ideal for monitoring:
- Website homepages and critical pages
- REST API endpoints and health checks
- CDN and static asset delivery
- Third-party service availability
- E-commerce checkout flows

<Note>
You'll need an HTTP or HTTPS URL to monitor. If you don't have one ready, you can use your company website or a public API for testing.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Monitors">
1. Log into your Checkly dashboard
2. Go to **Monitors** in the main navigation
3. Click **Create Monitor** and select **URL Monitor**

![Navigate to create URL monitor](/images/url-monitors/create-url-monitor-nav.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
Enter the essential details for your URL monitor:

**Monitor Name**: Give your monitor a descriptive name
```
Homepage Availability
```

**URL**: The HTTP/HTTPS endpoint you want to monitor
```
https://www.myapp.com
```

**Request Method**: Choose the HTTP method
- **GET**: Most common for websites and read-only APIs
- **POST**: For API endpoints that create or modify data
- **HEAD**: For checking availability without downloading content
- **Other methods**: PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS

![Basic URL monitor configuration](/images/url-monitors/url-monitor-basic-config.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set Request Options">
Configure how the monitor makes HTTP requests:

**Follow Redirects**: Enable to follow HTTP redirects (recommended: Yes)

**Request Headers**: Add custom headers if needed
```
User-Agent: Checkly Monitor Bot 1.0
Accept: application/json
```

**Request Body**: For POST/PUT requests, add the request data
```json
{
  "action": "health_check",
  "source": "monitoring"
}
```

<Tip>
For API monitoring, include authentication headers and appropriate content-type headers.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Response Validation">
Set up validation to ensure your service responds correctly:

**Expected Status Code**: HTTP status code that indicates success
```
200 OK
```

**Response Time Threshold**: Maximum acceptable response time
```
2000ms (2 seconds)
```

**Content Validation**: Text that should appear in the response
```
Welcome to MyApp
```

**Content Should Not Contain**: Text that indicates an error
```
Error 500
```

![URL monitor response validation settings](/images/url-monitors/url-monitor-response-config.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Monitoring Locations">
Select where to run your URL monitor from:

1. **Global Coverage**: Monitor from multiple continents
2. **Regional Focus**: Choose locations near your users
3. **Private Locations**: Use your own monitoring infrastructure

**Recommended setup**: Start with 3-5 locations in different regions where your users are located.

![Select monitoring locations](/images/url-monitors/url-monitor-locations.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set Monitoring Frequency">
Choose how often to check your URL:

- **Every minute**: For critical services requiring immediate detection
- **Every 5 minutes**: Good balance for most production services
- **Every 10 minutes**: For stable services with moderate requirements
- **Custom interval**: Set specific timing (up to 60 minutes)

```
Every 5 minutes
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure SSL/TLS Monitoring (HTTPS)">
For HTTPS URLs, enable SSL certificate monitoring:

**SSL Certificate Validation**: Automatically enabled for HTTPS
- ✅ Certificate validity and expiration checking
- ✅ Certificate chain verification  
- ✅ Hostname matching validation

**Certificate Expiration Alert**: Get notified before certificates expire
```
Alert 30 days before expiration
```

![SSL/TLS configuration for URL monitors](/images/url-monitors/url-monitor-ssl-config.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Authentication (If Required)">
Configure authentication for protected endpoints:

**Basic Authentication**:
```
Username: api_user
Password: secure_password123
```

**Bearer Token**:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**API Key Authentication**:
```
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
X-Client-ID: client-123
```

<Warning>
Store sensitive authentication credentials securely and rotate them regularly.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Alerting">
Set up notifications for when issues are detected:

**Alert Conditions**:
- ✅ HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- ✅ Response time threshold exceeded
- ✅ Content validation failed
- ✅ SSL certificate issues
- ✅ Network connectivity problems

**Alert Channels**: Choose notification methods
- Email alerts
- Slack notifications
- Webhook integrations  
- SMS alerts (premium feature)
- PagerDuty integration

![URL monitor alerting configuration](/images/url-monitors/url-monitor-alerts.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Save">
Before saving, validate your monitor configuration:

1. Click **Test Monitor** to run a test check
2. Review the test results for any issues
3. Adjust configuration if needed
4. Click **Create Monitor** to save

The test results will show:
- ✅ HTTP 200 OK response
- ✅ Response time: 342ms
- ✅ Content validation passed
- ✅ SSL certificate valid (for HTTPS)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### HTTP Status Code Errors

**4xx Client Errors**:
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check authentication credentials
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify API permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Confirm URL is correct

**5xx Server Errors**:
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Check server logs
- **502 Bad Gateway**: Verify proxy/load balancer configuration
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Check service health

### Timeout Errors
**Symptom**: Monitor shows timeout errors
**Causes**:
- Server overloaded or slow
- Network connectivity issues
- Timeout threshold too low

**Solutions**:
1. Increase response time threshold
2. Check server performance
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Optimize application performance

### Content Validation Failures
**Symptom**: Expected content not found in response
**Causes**:
- Page content changed
- Error page being served
- Dynamic content loading issues

**Solutions**:
1. Review actual response content
2. Update content validation patterns
3. Check for JavaScript-dependent content
4. Verify user agent compatibility

### SSL Certificate Issues
**Symptom**: Certificate validation failures
**Causes**:
- Certificate expired
- Invalid certificate chain
- Hostname mismatch

**Solutions**:
1. Check certificate expiration: `openssl s_client -connect domain:443`
2. Verify certificate chain completeness
3. Ensure certificate matches the hostname
4. Update certificates before expiration

## Advanced Configuration

### JSON Response Validation
For API endpoints, validate JSON structure:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["success", "ok"]},
    "timestamp": {"type": "integer"},
    "data": {"type": "object"}
  },
  "required": ["status"]
}
```

### Custom User Agent
Identify your monitoring requests:

```
User-Agent: MyApp-Monitor/1.0 (monitoring@mycompany.com)
```

### Regional Performance Testing
Monitor from specific locations to test regional performance:
- **North America**: us-east-1, us-west-1
- **Europe**: eu-west-1, eu-central-1  
- **Asia Pacific**: ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1

## Best Practices

### Configuration
- Use descriptive monitor names that identify the service and environment
- Set realistic response time thresholds based on your SLA requirements
- Include meaningful content validation to catch functional issues
- Monitor from locations where your actual users are based

### Monitoring Strategy
- Monitor critical user journeys, not just homepages
- Include both successful and error scenarios in your validation
- Test key functionality like login, checkout, or data submission
- Monitor dependencies like CDNs, APIs, and third-party services

### Security
- Use environment variables for sensitive authentication data
- Monitor for proper security headers in responses
- Check SSL certificate expiration proactively
- Validate that error responses don't expose sensitive information

### Performance
- Balance monitoring frequency with resource usage and costs
- Increase monitoring frequency during deployments and high-traffic periods
- Use geographic monitoring to understand global performance
- Set up performance budgets and track trends over time
