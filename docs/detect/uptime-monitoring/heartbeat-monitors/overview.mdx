Monitor your scheduled jobs, background tasks, and automated processes with Checkly's heartbeat monitoring. Unlike traditional active monitoring, heartbeat monitors work passively—they listen for regular "pings" from your tasks to ensure they're running as expected.

<Note>
Heartbeat monitors are available on our [Team and Enterprise plans](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing).
</Note>

## What are Heartbeat Monitors?

Heartbeat monitors are passive monitoring checks that wait for your automated tasks to report their successful completion. When your scheduled job, backup script, or cron job finishes successfully, it sends a simple HTTP request (a "ping") to Checkly to confirm it ran.

If Checkly doesn't receive a ping within the expected timeframe, it triggers alerts to notify you that something may have gone wrong.

## How Heartbeat Monitoring Works

The heartbeat monitoring process is straightforward:

1. **Create a monitor** - Set up a heartbeat monitor with your expected ping frequency
2. **Get your ping URL** - Checkly provides a unique URL for your task to ping
3. **Add the ping** - Include a simple HTTP request in your task's success path
4. **Monitor results** - Checkly tracks pings and alerts you when they're missing

<Tip>
Always add the heartbeat ping at the very end of your task, after all critical operations have completed successfully. This ensures you only get "success" pings when your job actually finished.
</Tip>

## Quick Example

Here's how you'd monitor a backup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh

# Run your backup process
pg_dump mydb > backup.sql
aws s3 cp backup.sql s3://my-backup-bucket/

# Only ping if backup succeeded
curl -m 5 --retry 3 https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-heartbeat-id
```

## Creating Your First Heartbeat Monitor

### 1. Basic Configuration

Start by giving your monitor a descriptive name and relevant tags:

- **Name**: Choose something descriptive like "Nightly Database Backup" or "Weekly Reports Job"
- **Tags**: Use tags to group related monitors (e.g., "production", "backups", "weekly")

### 2. Timing Configuration

Configure when you expect pings and how much flexibility to allow:

**Period**: How often your task should ping (e.g., every 24 hours, weekly)
**Grace Period**: Extra time to wait before alerting (e.g., 30 minutes grace for a daily job)

![Configure period and grace settings for your heartbeat monitor](/images/heartbeat-monitors/getting-started-period-and-grace.png)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Understanding Grace Periods">
Grace periods compensate for natural variance in job execution times. For example:

- **Daily backup at 2 AM** with 30-minute grace → Alert if no ping by 2:30 AM
- **Weekly report on Fridays** with 4-hour grace → Alert if no ping by end of Friday
- **Hourly sync job** with 5-minute grace → Alert if ping is more than 5 minutes late

Choose grace periods based on:
- Normal variance in your job execution time
- Acceptable delay before you need to know about failures
- Time needed for any retries or recovery processes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Timer Behavior">
The heartbeat timer works predictably:

- **First ping starts the timer** - When you send the first ping, monitoring begins
- **Each ping resets the timer** - Every successful ping resets the countdown
- **Alerts also reset the timer** - After an alert fires, the timer restarts
- **Deactivation resets everything** - Pausing and resuming a monitor restarts timing

This means if your job is supposed to run every 6 hours but runs late at hour 7, the next ping will be expected at hour 13 (7 + 6), not hour 12.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Alert Configuration

Connect your heartbeat monitor to [alert channels](/docs/communicate/alerts/) to be notified when pings are missing:

- Email notifications for immediate awareness
- Slack or Teams for team coordination  
- Webhooks for custom integrations
- PagerDuty for critical production jobs

## Ping URL and Implementation

Once created, your heartbeat monitor provides a unique ping URL. Your tasks should make an HTTP `GET` or `POST` request to this URL when they complete successfully.

### Ping Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Supported Methods" icon="globe">
- `GET` requests (most common)
- `POST` requests
- Custom headers for source tracking
</Card>

<Card title="Not Supported" icon="x">
- `PUT` or `DELETE` requests
- Requests from blocked bots
- Pings before first activation
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best Practices for Pings

**Always include timeout and retry options:**
```bash
# Good: With timeout and retries
curl -m 5 --retry 3 https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-id

# Bad: No timeout or retry protection
curl https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-id
```

**Position pings correctly in your code:**
```python
# Good: Ping only after success
try:
    run_backup()
    upload_to_s3()
    # Only ping if everything succeeded
    requests.get(ping_url, timeout=5)
except Exception as e:
    # Don't ping on failure - let heartbeat alert
    log_error(e)
```

**Use source headers for tracking:**
```bash
curl -H "Origin: backup-server-01" https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-id
```

## Manual Testing

You can manually send pings through the Checkly interface to:

- Test your monitor setup before deployment
- Start the timer for a newly created monitor
- Reset alerts during maintenance windows
- Verify alert configurations are working

Manual pings are available both on the monitor detail page and in the quick actions menu from your monitors list.

![Send manual pings from the heartbeat monitor overview page](/images/heartbeat-monitors/heartbeat-ping-overview-page.png)

You can also send manual pings directly from your monitors list using the quick actions menu:

## Integration Examples

### With the Checkly CLI

Define heartbeat monitors as code alongside your other monitoring:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { HeartbeatCheck } from 'checkly/constructs'

new HeartbeatCheck('weekly-newsletter', {
  name: 'Weekly Newsletter Campaign',
  period: 7,
  periodUnit: 'days',
  grace: 4,
  graceUnit: 'hours',
  tags: ['newsletter', 'marketing', 'weekly']
})
```

```javascript JavaScript
const { HeartbeatCheck } = require('checkly/constructs')

new HeartbeatCheck('database-backup', {
  name: 'Nightly Database Backup',
  period: 1,
  periodUnit: 'days', 
  grace: 30,
  graceUnit: 'minutes',
  tags: ['backup', 'database', 'critical']
})
```
</CodeGroup>

### With Infrastructure as Code

Many teams manage heartbeat monitors alongside their infrastructure using tools like Terraform, ensuring monitoring is created when new scheduled jobs are deployed.

## Understanding Results and Alerts

Heartbeat monitors provide different insights than active checks:

- **Ping History**: Timeline of when pings were received
- **Missed Pings**: Gaps where expected pings didn't arrive
- **Alert Timeline**: When alerts were triggered and resolved
- **Source Tracking**: Which systems or processes sent pings

Use this data to:
- Identify patterns in job failures
- Optimize grace periods based on actual variance
- Track the reliability of different scheduled processes
- Coordinate incident response when jobs fail

Remember: Heartbeat monitors detect when jobs fail to complete, but they can't tell you why a job failed. Combine heartbeat monitoring with application logging and error tracking for complete observability.
