import { Note, Warning, Tip, Steps } from 'mintlify/components'

This guide walks you through creating your first TCP monitor to check the availability of your network services, databases, or any TCP-based application.

## Before You Start

TCP monitors are perfect for checking:
- Database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
- Mail servers (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)  
- Custom TCP services and internal APIs
- SSH servers and file transfer services
- Load balancers and proxy servers

<Note>
You'll need a service running on a specific TCP port. If you don't have one ready, you can use a public service like a mail server or database for testing.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Monitors">
1. Log into your Checkly dashboard
2. Go to **Monitors** in the main navigation
3. Click **Create Monitor** and select **TCP Monitor**

![Navigate to create TCP monitor](/images/tcp-monitors/create-tcp-monitor-nav.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
Enter the essential details for your TCP monitor:

**Monitor Name**: Give your monitor a descriptive name
```
Production MySQL Database
```

**Host/IP Address**: The server you want to monitor
```
db.myapp.com
```

**Port**: The TCP port your service is listening on
```
3306
```

**Protocol**: Choose the appropriate protocol
- **TCP**: Standard TCP connection
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypted connection
- **Custom**: For specific protocol requirements

![Basic TCP monitor configuration](/images/tcp-monitors/tcp-monitor-basic-config.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set Connection Options">
Configure how the monitor connects to your service:

**Connection Timeout**: Maximum time to wait for connection (default: 10 seconds)
```
15 seconds
```

**Read Timeout**: Time to wait for response after connection (default: 10 seconds)
```
10 seconds
```

<Tip>
Set timeouts slightly higher than your service's typical response time to avoid false alerts.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Response Validation (Optional)">
For more precise monitoring, validate the service response:

**Expected Response**: Text pattern that should appear in the response
```
MySQL Server
```

**Connection String**: Data to send after establishing connection
```
PING\n
```

<Warning>
Be careful with connection strings - some services may close connections after receiving unexpected data.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Choose Monitoring Locations">
Select where to run your TCP monitor from:

1. **Global Locations**: Monitor from multiple continents
2. **Regional Focus**: Choose locations near your users
3. **Private Locations**: Use your own monitoring infrastructure

**Recommended setup**: Start with 3-5 locations spread across different regions.

![Select monitoring locations](/images/tcp-monitors/tcp-monitor-locations.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set Monitoring Frequency">
Choose how often to check your service:

- **Every minute**: For critical services requiring immediate detection
- **Every 5 minutes**: Good balance for most production services  
- **Every 15 minutes**: For stable services with less critical requirements
- **Custom interval**: Set specific timing needs

```
Every 5 minutes
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure SSL/TLS (If Applicable)">
For encrypted connections, enable SSL/TLS monitoring:

**SSL Certificate Validation**: Check certificate validity and expiration
- ✅ Verify certificate chain
- ✅ Check expiration date (alert 30 days before)
- ✅ Validate hostname matching

**SSL Protocols**: Choose minimum required version
```
TLS 1.2 or higher
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Alerting">
Configure when and how you'll be notified of issues:

**Alert Conditions**:
- ✅ Connection failure
- ✅ Timeout exceeded  
- ✅ Response validation failed
- ✅ SSL certificate issues

**Alert Channels**: Choose your notification methods
- Email alerts
- Slack notifications  
- Webhook integrations
- SMS alerts (premium feature)

</Step>

<Step title="Test and Save">
Before saving, test your monitor configuration:

1. Click **Test Monitor** to run a test check
2. Review the test results for any issues
3. Adjust configuration if needed
4. Click **Create Monitor** to save

The test will show:
- ✅ Connection successful
- ✅ Response time: 45ms
- ✅ Response validation passed
- ✅ SSL certificate valid (if applicable)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Configuration Examples

### Database Server (MySQL)
```yaml
Name: Production MySQL
Host: db.production.com
Port: 3306
Protocol: TCP
Connection Timeout: 15s
Expected Response: (leave empty for basic connectivity)
```

### SMTP Mail Server
```yaml
Name: Mail Server SMTP
Host: mail.company.com  
Port: 587
Protocol: SSL/TLS
Connection Timeout: 10s
Expected Response: "220"
```

### Redis Cache Server
```yaml
Name: Redis Cache
Host: redis.internal.com
Port: 6379
Protocol: TCP
Connection String: "PING\r\n"
Expected Response: "+PONG"
```

### SSH Server
```yaml
Name: Production SSH
Host: server.example.com
Port: 22
Protocol: TCP
Expected Response: "SSH-2.0"
```

## Understanding Results

Once your TCP monitor is running, you'll see:

### Status Dashboard
- **Current Status**: Online/Offline indicator
- **Response Time**: Latest connection time
- **Uptime Percentage**: Availability over time periods
- **Location Results**: Status from each monitoring location

### Detailed Metrics
- **Connection Time**: Time to establish TCP connection
- **Response Time**: Complete request/response cycle
- **DNS Resolution Time**: Hostname lookup duration
- **SSL Handshake Time**: Certificate validation time (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Refused
**Symptom**: Monitor shows "Connection refused" errors
**Causes**:
- Service is not running
- Port is blocked by firewall
- Incorrect host/port configuration

**Solutions**:
1. Verify service is running: `netstat -tlnp | grep :3306`
2. Check firewall rules
3. Test connectivity: `telnet hostname port`

### Timeout Errors
**Symptom**: Monitor times out without connecting
**Causes**:
- Network latency or packet loss
- Service overloaded
- Timeout set too low

**Solutions**:
1. Increase connection timeout
2. Check network connectivity
3. Monitor service performance

### SSL Certificate Issues
**Symptom**: SSL validation failures
**Causes**:
- Certificate expired
- Hostname mismatch
- Invalid certificate chain

**Solutions**:
1. Check certificate validity: `openssl s_client -connect hostname:port`
2. Verify certificate expiration dates
3. Update certificates before expiration

## Best Practices

### Configuration
- Use descriptive monitor names that identify the service and environment
- Set realistic timeout values based on service performance
- Enable SSL certificate monitoring for all encrypted connections
- Monitor from locations relevant to your user base

### Monitoring Strategy
- Start with basic connectivity, add response validation as needed
- Use different monitoring frequencies based on service criticality
- Combine TCP monitors with application-level checks for comprehensive coverage

### Alerting
- Configure multiple alert channels for redundancy
- Set up escalation rules for critical services
- Test alert configurations regularly
- Use maintenance windows during planned downtime
