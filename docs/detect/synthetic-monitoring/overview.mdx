# Synthetic Monitoring Overview

Synthetic monitoring simulates real user interactions with your applications to proactively identify issues and ensure optimal user experiences. Checkly's synthetic monitoring capabilities help you maintain high-quality service delivery.

## What is Synthetic Monitoring?

Synthetic monitoring uses automated scripts to simulate user journeys through your application. Unlike traditional uptime monitoring, it tests complete workflows and user experiences, not just endpoint availability.

## Key Concepts

### Monitoring Approaches
- **API Monitoring**: Test API endpoints with realistic request patterns
- **Browser Monitoring**: Simulate real user interactions in browser environments
- **Multi-step Monitoring**: Combine multiple actions to test complete user journeys
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and user experience metrics

### User Journey Simulation
- **Critical Paths**: Monitor the most important user workflows
- **Realistic Data**: Use test data that represents actual user scenarios
- **Geographic Testing**: Test from locations where your users are located
- **Device Simulation**: Test across different devices and browsers

### Performance Insights
- **Response Time Analysis**: Understand performance bottlenecks
- **User Experience Metrics**: Track metrics that affect user satisfaction
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify performance patterns over time
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Find areas for improvement

## Getting Started

To begin synthetic monitoring:

1. Identify critical user journeys in your application
2. Create synthetic test scripts for these workflows
3. Configure monitoring schedules and locations
4. Set up performance thresholds and alerting
5. Monitor results and optimize based on insights
