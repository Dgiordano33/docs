## Overview

Checkly is a comprehensive Application Reliability platform that enables teams to test, monitor, and observe their web applications, APIs, and other services in a unified workflow. Built for modern development teams, Checkly uses Monitoring as Code to help integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines, allowing you to catch issues before they reach production.

The platform combines three core monitoring capabilities: 
- **Detect** for proactive monitoring through synthetic tests and uptime checks
- **Communicate** for intelligent alerting and status pages
- **Resolve** for deep observability with distributed tracing and AI-powered incident analysis.

## Differentiators

  <Card title="Monitoring-as-Code Philosophy" icon="code">
    Unlike traditional monitoring tools, Checkly treats monitoring as code, allowing you to version control, review, and deploy your monitoring alongside your application code using popular frameworks like Playwright and Puppeteer.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Developer-First Experience" icon="terminal">
    Built by developers for developers, Checkly offers a CLI-first approach with seamless integration into existing development workflows, making monitoring setup as natural as writing tests.

## Checkly Is Best Fit For
**DevOps and SRE Teams** looking for programmable monitoring that integrates seamlessly with their existing infrastructure-as-code and GitOps workflows.

**Full-Stack Engineering Teams** who want to shift monitoring left and treat monitoring as an integral part of their development process rather than an afterthought.

**Engineering Teams Using Modern Web Technologies** who want monitoring that understands modern JavaScript frameworks, SPAs, and API-first architectures.
