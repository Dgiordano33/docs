Checkly provides two scheduling strategies for running checks: **Round-robin** or **Parallel scheduling**. To select a scheduling strategy go to ‘Scheduling and locations’ when creating or editing a check.

## Round-robin

Using **Round-robin Scheduling**, your check will run on one of the selected locations each time it is scheduled. The next check run will be scheduled on a different location from the list until all locations have been run once, and the check rotates back to the first location in the list.

When using the **Round-robin Scheduling** strategy you can choose to have retries to run from a random location of the ones selected, or run it from the same location as the first attempt.

Use **Round-robin Scheduling** when the service you are monitoring can be considered available as long as at least one location is available and detecting a regional outage is not critical.

## Parallel

With **Parallel Scheduling**, each time the check is scheduled it will run once from each selected location. When running a check in parallel, retries will always be run from the same location as the first attempt.

Use **Parallel Scheduling** to reduce detection times for regional outages and reduce time to detect service degradations that impact the customer experience.
