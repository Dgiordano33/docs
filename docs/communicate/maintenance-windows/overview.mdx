Maintenance windows allow you to schedule planned downtime for your services, preventing false alerts and preserving accurate availability metrics during system updates, deployments, and infrastructure maintenance activities.

## What are Maintenance Windows?

Maintenance windows are scheduled periods during which your monitoring checks are temporarily suspended. During these windows, Checkly stops executing checks for the targeted services, eliminating false alerts while preserving historical availability data.

## Core Maintenance Window Benefits

### Prevention of False Alerts
During maintenance windows, monitoring checks are completely suspended:

```yaml
# Maintenance window behavior
Before Maintenance Window:
  Check Status: Running every 5 minutes
  Alert Status: Active monitoring
  Dashboard Status: Real-time updates

During Maintenance Window:
  Check Status: Suspended (not executed)
  Alert Status: Maintenance mode (no alerts)
  Dashboard Status: Maintenance indicator

After Maintenance Window:
  Check Status: Resumed automatically
  Alert Status: Active monitoring restored
  Dashboard Status: Real-time updates resumed
```

### Availability Calculation Preservation
Maintenance windows ensure accurate long-term metrics:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Without maintenance windows" icon="x-circle">
**Degraded Metrics**
- Planned downtime counts as service failure
- Artificially low availability percentages
- Inaccurate SLA reporting
- Misleading historical trends
</Card>

<Card title="With maintenance windows" icon="check-circle">
**Accurate Metrics**
- Planned downtime excluded from calculations
- True service availability reporting
- Accurate SLA compliance measurement
- Clean historical performance data
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Real-World Impact Example

```yaml
# Service availability calculation example
Service: Payment API
Monitoring Period: 30 days (720 hours)
Planned Maintenance: 4 hours

Without Maintenance Window:
  Total Monitored Time: 720 hours
  Failed Time: 4 hours (maintenance)
  Calculated Availability: 99.44% (716/720)
  
With Maintenance Window:
  Total Monitored Time: 716 hours (720 - 4)
  Failed Time: 0 hours
  Calculated Availability: 100% (716/716)
  
Result: Accurate representation of actual service reliability
```

![Maintenance Windows Editor](/images/maintenance-windows/maintenance-windows-editor.png)

## Scheduling Configuration

### Basic Schedule Setup
Every maintenance window requires fundamental timing information:

```yaml
# Basic maintenance window configuration
Maintenance Window: "Database Upgrade"
Description: "Monthly database maintenance and optimization"

Schedule Configuration:
  Start Date: 2024-02-15
  Start Time: 02:00 UTC
  Duration: 4 hours
  End Time: 06:00 UTC (calculated automatically)
```

<Warning>
All maintenance window times are configured in UTC timezone to ensure global consistency. Make sure to convert your local maintenance times to UTC when setting up schedules.
</Warning>

### UTC Timezone Considerations
Understanding UTC timing is crucial for global maintenance coordination:

```yaml
# UTC conversion examples
Local Time Examples:
  Pacific Standard Time (PST): UTC - 8 hours
  Eastern Standard Time (EST): UTC - 5 hours
  Central European Time (CET): UTC + 1 hour
  Japan Standard Time (JST): UTC + 9 hours

Example Maintenance Schedule:
  Planned Local Time: 2:00 AM PST (Pacific)
  Converted to UTC: 10:00 AM UTC
  Displayed to Teams:
    - PST team sees: 2:00 AM PST
    - EST team sees: 5:00 AM EST  
    - CET team sees: 11:00 AM CET
    - JST team sees: 7:00 PM JST
```

<Tip>
Use online UTC conversion tools or coordinate with your global teams to ensure maintenance windows are scheduled at appropriate local times for all stakeholders.
</Tip>

## Recurring Maintenance Patterns

### Repeat Configuration Options
Create maintenance windows that automatically repeat according to your operational schedule:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Daily repetition" icon="sun">
**Daily Maintenance**
- Every day at specified time
- Useful for daily backup windows
- Log rotation and cleanup tasks
- Regular system optimization
</Card>

<Card title="Weekly repetition" icon="calendar-week">
**Weekly Maintenance**
- Same day each week
- Common for weekend maintenance
- Regular system updates
- Weekly backup and archival tasks
</Card>

<Card title="Monthly repetition" icon="calendar">
**Monthly Maintenance**
- Same date each month
- Major system updates
- Monthly compliance tasks
- Quarterly business reviews
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Repeat Configuration Examples

```yaml
# Daily backup maintenance
Daily Backup Window:
  Name: "Daily Database Backup"
  Start Time: 01:00 UTC
  Duration: 2 hours
  Repeat: Every day
  End Date: No end date (ongoing)

# Weekly server maintenance  
Weekly Server Maintenance:
  Name: "Weekly Server Updates"
  Start Time: Sunday 03:00 UTC
  Duration: 3 hours
  Repeat: Every week
  Repetition Count: 52 (one year)

# Monthly system maintenance
Monthly System Maintenance:
  Name: "Monthly System Upgrade"
  Start Time: First Saturday 02:00 UTC
  Duration: 6 hours
  Repeat: Every month
  End Date: 2024-12-31
```

### Advanced Repeat Logic
Handle complex scheduling scenarios with intelligent repeat behavior:

<Steps>
<Step title="Monthly Date Handling">
Automatic adjustment when target date doesn't exist in month
</Step>

<Step title="End Date Management">
Configure when recurring maintenance should stop
</Step>

<Step title="Repetition Counting">
Set specific number of repetitions instead of end date
</Step>

<Step title="Holiday Considerations">
Plan around business calendars and holiday schedules
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Monthly Date Edge Cases
Checkly handles complex monthly scheduling automatically:

```yaml
# Monthly date handling examples
Scheduled for 31st of each month:
  January 31st: ✓ Executes as scheduled
  February 31st: → Adjusts to February 28th (or 29th in leap year)
  March 31st: ✓ Executes as scheduled
  April 31st: → Adjusts to April 30th
  May 31st: ✓ Executes as scheduled

Result: Consistent monthly maintenance without manual intervention
```

## Check and Check Group Targeting

### Tag-Based Targeting System
Use Checkly's tag system to efficiently target maintenance windows:

```yaml
# Tag-based targeting examples
Production Database Maintenance:
  Target Tags: ["production", "database"]
  Affected Checks:
    - Primary Database Health
    - Replica Database Status  
    - Database Connection Pool
    - Backup System Check

API Service Maintenance:
  Target Tags: ["api", "customer-facing"]
  Affected Checks:
    - Payment API
    - User Authentication API
    - Search API
    - Notification Service

Infrastructure Maintenance:
  Target Tags: ["infrastructure", "core"]
  Affected Checks:
    - Load Balancer Health
    - CDN Status
    - DNS Resolution
    - Certificate Status
```

### Future-Proof Configuration
Tag-based targeting automatically includes new checks that match your criteria:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Automatic inclusion" icon="plus-circle">
**Dynamic Check Inclusion**
- New checks with matching tags automatically included

```

## API Integration and Automation

### Programmatic Maintenance Management
Integrate maintenance windows with your operational workflows:

```javascript
// Create maintenance window via API
const maintenanceWindow = await checkly.maintenanceWindows.create({
  name: "Database Maintenance",
  description: "Monthly database optimization",
  startsAt: "2024-02-15T02:00:00Z",
  endsAt: "2024-02-15T06:00:00Z",
  repeatInterval: "month",
  repeatCount: 12,
  tags: ["production", "database"]
});

// Update existing maintenance window
await checkly.maintenanceWindows.update(maintenanceWindow.id, {
  startsAt: "2024-02-15T03:00:00Z", // Delayed start
  description: "Monthly database optimization - delayed 1 hour"
});

// Cancel maintenance window
await checkly.maintenanceWindows.delete(maintenanceWindow.id);
```

### Automation Integration Examples

  Configuration: HCL-based maintenance window definitions
  State Management: Terraform state tracking
  Lifecycle: Automated creation/modification/deletion
```

## Best Practices for Maintenance Windows

### Scheduling Strategy
- **Advance planning**: Schedule maintenance windows well in advance when possible
- **Business impact**: Consider business hours and user activity patterns
- **Global coordination**: Account for multiple timezones in global organizations
- **Duration estimation**: Allow adequate time for maintenance tasks with buffer

### Communication and Coordination
- **Stakeholder notification**: Inform relevant teams and stakeholders about maintenance
- **Status page updates**: Use status pages to communicate planned maintenance
- **Emergency contacts**: Ensure emergency contact procedures during maintenance
- **Rollback planning**: Have rollback procedures ready if maintenance extends beyond window

### Operational Excellence
- **Tag strategy**: Maintain consistent and meaningful tag organization
- **Regular review**: Periodically review and optimize maintenance window configurations
- **Impact analysis**: Monitor the effectiveness of maintenance window coverage
- **Documentation**: Document maintenance procedures and lessons learned

<Note>
Maintenance windows are most effective when integrated into a comprehensive operational strategy that includes monitoring, alerting, communication, and incident response procedures.
</Note>

<Warning>
Remember that maintenance windows suspend monitoring for affected checks. Ensure you have alternative monitoring or manual verification procedures for critical maintenance activities.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Start with conservative maintenance window durations and adjust based on historical maintenance performance. It's better to have slightly longer windows than to exceed planned maintenance time.
