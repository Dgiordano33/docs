Dashboards provide a public-facing way to communicate the status of your monitoring checks and services to users who don't have direct access to your Checkly account. Create professional, branded status displays for customers, internal teams, or specific stakeholders.

## What are Checkly Dashboards?

Dashboards are public status pages that display real-time monitoring data, allowing you to communicate system health and incidents to external audiences without exposing your internal monitoring tools.

Displayed Checks:
  - Payment API (tags: production, customer-facing, payment)
  - User Authentication (tags: production, customer-facing, auth)
  - Website Homepage (tags: production, customer-facing, frontend)

Hidden Checks:
  - Internal Admin API (tags: production, internal)
  - Development Database (tags: development, internal)
```

### Real-Time Status Display
Dashboards provide immediate visual feedback on system health:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Operational" icon="check-circle">

- Normal response times
- System fully operational
- User experience optimal
</Card>

<Card title="Degraded" icon="alert-triangle">

- User experience affected
</Card>

<Card title="Down" icon="x-circle">
**Red Status**

### Performance Metrics Display
Comprehensive performance data for transparency and accountability:

| Metric | Time Period | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Availability** | 24h, 7d, 30d | Percentage of successful checks | SLA reporting |
| **P95 Response Time** | 24h, 7d, 30d | 95th percentile response time | Performance baseline |
| **P99 Response Time** | 24h, 7d, 30d | 99th percentile response time | Performance outliers |

- **Incident transparency**: Be honest about issues and resolution timelines

## Advanced Dashboard Features

### Multi-Dashboard Strategy
Use multiple dashboards for different audiences and purposes:

```yaml
# Multi-dashboard architecture example
Executive Dashboard:
  Audience: Leadership and management
  Content: High-level service health
  Focus: SLA metrics and major incidents
  
Engineering Dashboard:
  Audience: Development and operations teams
  Content: Detailed system health
  Focus: Technical metrics and all incidents
  
Customer Dashboard:
  Audience: External customers
  Content: Customer-facing services only
  Focus: Service availability and customer impact
```

### Integration with External Tools
Connect dashboards with existing communication and monitoring tools:

- **Status page integration**: Link with existing status page solutions
- **Slack notifications**: Automated dashboard incident updates
- **Email alerts**: Notify stakeholders of dashboard incidents
- **API access**: Programmatic dashboard management and updates

<Note>
Dashboards are most effective when they're part of a comprehensive communication strategy that includes alerting, incident response, and customer support processes.
</Note>

<Warning>
Remember that dashboards are public by default. Always review which checks and data you're exposing before sharing dashboard URLs with external audiences.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Start with a simple dashboard configuration and gradually add more sophisticated features like custom CSS styling and private access controls as your needs evolve.
