Dashboard authentication allows you to control access to sensitive monitoring information by requiring authentication before users can view your dashboard. This is essential when sharing internal metrics or when monitoring data contains sensitive business information.

## Dashboard Privacy Options

By default, Checkly dashboards are public and accessible to anyone with the URL. For sensitive monitoring data, you can enable authentication to restrict access:

<Card title="Password protection" icon="lock">
**Shared Password Access**
- Single password for all dashboard viewers
- Available on Team and Enterprise plans  
- Quick setup with immediate activation
- Suitable for external stakeholders
</Card>

<Card title="Checkly account login" icon="user-check">
**Account-Based Authentication**
- Requires existing Checkly account
- Available on Enterprise plans only
- Granular access control options
- Integrated with team permissions
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Password Protection Setup

### Enabling Password Protection
Configure shared password access for your dashboard:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Dashboard Settings">
Navigate to your dashboard and open the configuration settings
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Password Protection">
Toggle the password protection option in the authentication section
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Password">
Click generate to create a secure password for dashboard access
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Password">
Copy the generated password - it will only be shown once for security
</Step>

<Step title="Share Securely">
Distribute the password to authorized users through secure channels
</Step>

<Step title="Test Access">
Verify password protection is working correctly
</Step>
</Steps>

### Password Authentication Workflow
When password protection is enabled, users experience this access flow:

```yaml
# User access experience
Step 1: User visits dashboard URL
Step 2: Password prompt appears
Step 3: User enters provided password
Step 4: Access granted to dashboard content
Step 5: Session maintained during browser session

# Session management
Session Duration: Browser session (until tab/browser closed)
Password Persistence: Not stored in browser for security
Re-authentication: Required for new browser sessions
```

<Warning>
The generated password is displayed only once for security reasons. Make sure to copy and store it securely before closing the generation dialog.
</Warning>

### Password Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Password management" icon="shield">
**Secure Distribution**
- Share passwords through secure, encrypted channels
- Avoid sending passwords via plain email
- Use password managers for storage
- Regularly rotate passwords for high-security dashboards
</Card>

<Card title="Access control" icon="users">
**User Management**
- Document who has access to password-protected dashboards
- Remove access when team members leave
- Use different passwords for different dashboard audiences
- Monitor dashboard access patterns when possible
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Checkly Account Authentication

### Enterprise Account Login
For Enterprise plans, enable Checkly account-based authentication:

<Steps>
<Step title="Enterprise Plan Verification">
Confirm your account has Enterprise plan access
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Account Authentication">
Configure dashboard to require Checkly account login
</Step>

<Step title="Set Access Permissions">
Define which account users can access the dashboard
</Step>

<Step title="Test Authentication">
Verify the login flow works correctly for authorized users
</Step>
</Steps>

### Account Authentication Benefits

```yaml

## Authentication Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- **Regular access review**: Periodically review who has dashboard access
- **Password rotation**: Change passwords regularly for high-security dashboards
- **Secure distribution**: Use encrypted channels for sharing authentication credentials
- **Access logging**: Monitor dashboard access patterns when possible

### User Experience Optimization  
- **Clear instructions**: Provide clear guidance for accessing protected dashboards
- **Backup access**: Have alternative access methods for critical stakeholders
- **Training**: Ensure users understand authentication requirements
- **Support processes**: Establish procedures for authentication issues

### Compliance and Governance
- **Access documentation**: Maintain records of who has dashboard access
- **Audit trails**: Track authentication events for compliance requirements
- **Data classification**: Match authentication requirements to data sensitivity
- **Regular reviews**: Conduct periodic access control assessments

<Tip>
For most use cases, password protection provides an optimal balance of security and ease of use. Reserve Checkly account authentication for scenarios requiring granular access control or integration with existing team permissions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Remember that authentication only controls access to viewing the dashboard. The underlying monitoring checks and data security depend on your overall Checkly account security configuration.
