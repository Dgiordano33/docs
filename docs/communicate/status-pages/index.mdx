Status pages provide transparent communication about your service health and incidents to customers, users, and stakeholders. Checkly's status pages automatically reflect your monitoring results and create a professional interface for incident communication.

## What are Status Pages?

Status pages are public-facing websites that display real-time information about your services' health and operational status. They serve as the primary communication channel between your team and your users during both normal operations and incidents.

## Core Status Page Components

### Services
Services represent functional pieces of your application that users interact with:

```yaml
# Example service structure
Payment Processing:
  Description: "Credit card and payment processing"
  Connected Checks: [Payment API, Stripe Integration, PayPal API]
  Incident Automation: Enabled
  Status: Operational

User Authentication:
  Description: "Login and user management systems"
  Connected Checks: [Auth API, OAuth Service, User Database]
  Incident Automation: Enabled
  Status: Operational
```

### Service Cards
Organize and group services for better user experience:

- **Visual grouping**: Related services displayed together
- **Custom ordering**: Arrange services by importance or user impact
- **Status aggregation**: Overall health based on connected checks
- **Description management**: Clear service explanations for users

### Automatic Incident Management
Connect monitoring checks directly to services for automated incident handling:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Automatic incident creation" icon="zap">
**When Checks Fail**
- Incident opened automatically
- Service status updated to "Major Outage" or "Partial Outage"
- Subscribers notified via email
- Status page reflects current state
</Card>

<Card title="Automatic incident resolution" icon="check-circle">
**When Checks Recover**
- Incident automatically resolved
- Service status returned to "Operational"
- Resolution notification sent to subscribers
- Historical record maintained
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setting Up Your Status Page

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Your Status Page">
Choose a name and configure basic settings for your status page
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Subdomain">
Set up your status page URL (e.g., `status.yourcompany.com` or `yourcompany.checkly.run`)
</Step>

<Step title="Add Services">
Create services that represent the functional components your users interact with
</Step>

<Step title="Connect Monitoring Checks">
Link your existing Checkly checks to services for automatic incident management
</Step>

<Step title="Customize Appearance">
Upload logos, set themes, and configure branding to match your company style
</Step>

<Step title="Test and Go Live">
Verify incident automation works correctly and share your status page URL
</Step>
</Steps>

### Service Creation and Management

Create services that align with how your users think about your application:

```yaml
# Good service examples
Frontend Application:
  - Website loading and navigation
  - User interface responsiveness
  - Client-side functionality

API Services:
  - Core API endpoints
  - Authentication services
  - Data processing capabilities

Third-party Integrations:
  - Payment processors
  - Email delivery services
  - External data sources
```

<Tip>
Create services from your users' perspective, not your internal architecture. Users care about "Login" working, not whether your "Auth microservice cluster" is healthy.
</Tip>

## Custom Domain Configuration

### Domain Setup Process
Configure custom domains to maintain brand consistency:

<Steps>
<Step title="DNS Configuration">
Add CNAME and TXT records to your DNS provider
</Step>

<Step title="Domain Verification">
Checkly verifies domain ownership through TXT records
</Step>

<Step title="SSL Certificate">
Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal
</Step>

<Step title="Go Live">
Status page becomes available at your custom domain
</Step>
</Steps>

### Required DNS Records

```text
# CNAME Record (required)
Type: CNAME
Name: status (or your chosen subdomain)
Value: cnames.checklyhq.com

# TXT Record (required for verification)
Type: TXT
Name: _checkly-status-page-domain-verification.status
Value: [Verification code provided by Checkly]
```

<Warning>
For Cloudflare users: Ensure the orange cloud (proxy) is **disabled** for your status page CNAME record. The record should be "DNS only" (gray cloud) for proper functionality.
</Warning>

## Status Page Customization

</Steps>

### Incident Update Process
Keep users informed throughout incident lifecycle:

```yaml
# Incident progression example
Initial Report:

  Message: "We are aware of login issues and are investigating"
  Timestamp: "2024-01-15 14:30 UTC"

Progress Update:
  Status: "Identified"
  Message: "Issue identified with authentication service, implementing fix"
  Timestamp: "2024-01-15 14:45 UTC"

Resolution:
  Status: "Resolved"
  Message: "Authentication service restored, all systems operational"
  Timestamp: "2024-01-15 15:15 UTC"
```

### Automated Incident Management
Leverage monitoring integration for hands-free incident communication:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Check failure detection" icon="exclamation-triangle">
**Automatic Incident Opening**
- Failed check triggers incident creation
- Service status automatically updated
- Subscribers immediately notified
- Status page reflects current state
</Card>

<Card title="Check recovery detection" icon="check-circle">
**Automatic Incident Resolution**
- Successful check triggers incident closure
- Service status returned to operational

- Incident marked as resolved
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Subscriber Management and Notifications

### Email Subscription System
Enable users to stay informed about service status:

<Steps>
<Step title="Subscription Setup">
Users provide email address for status updates
</Step>

<Step title="Email Verification">
Verification email sent to confirm subscription
</Step>

<Step title="Notification Preferences">

<Step title="Historical Accuracy">
Create incidents for past outages or maintenance windows
</Step>

<Step title="Custom Date Selection">
Set specific dates and times for historical incidents
</Step>

</Tip>

### Multi-Check Service Integration
Connect multiple monitoring checks to a single service:

```yaml
# Example: E-commerce Checkout Service
Checkout Service:
  Connected Checks:
    - Payment Processing API
    - Inventory Management API
    - Order Confirmation Email
    - Shopping Cart Functionality
  
  Incident Logic:
    - Any single check failure = "Partial Outage"
    - Multiple check failures = "Major Outage"
    - All checks failing = "Complete Outage"
```

## Status Page Best Practices
