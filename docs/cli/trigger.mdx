## `npx checkly trigger`

The `trigger` command is similar to the `test` command, but "triggers" checks already in your Checkly account. This works regardless of whether you created these checks via a Project with CLI constructs, via the UI or using Terraform.

Because `trigger` does not rely on any Project or as-code representation of your checks, the invocation is slightly different, as there are no files to reference for instance.

### Usage Examples

Trigger all checks:

```bash
npx checkly trigger
```

Trigger checks tagged with "production" and "api" and pass in an ENVIRONMENT_URL:

```bash
npx checkly trigger --tags=production,api -e ENVIRONMENT_URL="https://staging.acme.com"
```

Trigger all checks to run in location `eu-west-1` and record a test session named "Adhoc test run":

```bash
npx checkly trigger --record --test-session-name="Adhoc test run" --location=eu-west-1
```

### Flags

- `--config` or `-c`: Specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--env <key=value>` or `-e`: Pass environment variables to the check execution runtime. Passed variables overwrite any existing variables stored in your Checkly account.
- `--env-file`: Read variables from a `.env` file by passing the file path, e.g. `--env-file="./.env"`
- `--location <location>` or `-l`: Run checks against a specified location, e.g. `eu-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`.
- `--private-location <private location ID>`: Run checks against the specified private location.
- `--record`: Record tests results in Checkly as a test session.
- `--reporter` or `-r`: One or more reporters for the test output. Options are: `list|dot|ci|github|json`. You can use multiple reporters by specifying the flag multiple times, e.g. `--reporter=list --reporter=json`.
- `--tags` or `-t`: Filter the checks to be triggered using a comma separated list of tags. Checks will only be run if they contain all the specified tags. Multiple `--tags` flags can be passed, in which case checks will be run if they match any of the `--tags` filters, i.e. `--tags production,webapp --tags staging,backend` will run checks with tags (production AND webapp) OR (staging AND backend).
- `--test-session-name`: A name to use when storing results in Checkly with `--record`.
- `--retries`: How many times to retry a failing check run. 0 by default and maximum 3.
- `--timeout`: A fallback timeout (in seconds) to wait for checks to complete. 600 seconds by default.
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Always show the full logs of the checks.
