# Traces

Distributed tracing helps you understand how requests flow through your application and identify performance bottlenecks and failures. Checkly's tracing capabilities provide deep insights into your application's behavior.

## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through your application's services and infrastructure. It helps you:

- Understand request flow across services
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Debug failures and errors
- Optimize application performance

## Trace Components

### Spans
Individual units of work within a trace:
- **Root Span**: The initial request that starts the trace
- **Child Spans**: Subsequent operations within the request
- **Span Attributes**: Metadata about the operation
- **Span Events**: Important events during execution

### Trace Context
Information that links spans together:
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for the entire trace
- **Span ID**: Unique identifier for each span
- **Parent Span ID**: Links child spans to their parent

### Trace Sampling
Control which traces are collected:
- **Always On**: Collect all traces
- **Probabilistic**: Sample a percentage of traces
- **Adaptive**: Adjust sampling based on error rates

## Setting Up Tracing

### 1. Instrumentation
Add tracing instrumentation to your application:
- Use OpenTelemetry SDKs
- Configure trace exporters
- Set up span attributes and events

### 2. Configuration
Configure tracing settings:
- Set sampling rates
- Define trace retention policies
- Configure trace exporters

### 3. Integration
Integrate with your existing monitoring:
- Connect traces to metrics and logs
- Set up alerting on trace data
- Configure dashboards for trace visualization

## Trace Analysis

### Trace Visualization
View traces in an intuitive interface:
- Timeline view of request flow
- Service dependency mapping
- Performance breakdown by service

### Error Analysis
Identify and debug failures:
- Error location and context
- Stack traces and error details
- Related logs and metrics

### Performance Insights
Optimize application performance:
- Response time breakdown
- Database query analysis
- External service calls

## Best Practices

### Instrumentation Strategy
- Instrument all critical services
- Add meaningful span attributes
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include business context in traces

### Sampling Configuration
- Balance data volume with insights
- Sample more traces during incidents
- Use adaptive sampling for production
- Preserve traces for critical paths

### Performance Impact
- Minimize overhead of tracing
- Use asynchronous trace export
- Configure appropriate buffer sizes
- Monitor tracing system performance

## Advanced Features

### Custom Attributes
Add business-specific context to traces:
- User information
- Request parameters
- Business metrics
- Custom metadata

### Trace Correlation
Link traces with other observability data:
- Log correlation
- Metric correlation
- Alert correlation
- Incident correlation

### Trace Analytics
Analyze trace patterns and trends:
- Performance trends
- Error patterns
- Service dependencies
- Usage patterns

## Integration Options

### OpenTelemetry
Use OpenTelemetry standards for instrumentation.

### Custom Exporters
Integrate with your existing observability stack.

### API Access
Programmatically access trace data for custom analysis.
