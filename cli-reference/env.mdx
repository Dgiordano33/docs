## `npx checkly env`

Manage the global variables of a Checkly account. You can list, add, remove, update and export environment variables.

### `npx checkly env pull`

Export global variables from your Checkly account to a local `.env` file or a different file of your choice. For secrets, only the key will be exported, not the value.

```bash
checkly env pull [FILENAME] [-f]
```

- `FILENAME`: You can specify a particular environment variable file, e.g. `.env.local`
- `--force` or `-f`: Skips the confirmation dialog when pulling environment variables to existing env file.

```bash
npx checkly env pull -f
```
Pull all global variables to the `.env` file and overwrite it if it already exists.

### `npx checkly env ls`

List global variables. This command does not list variables on group or check level. For secrets, only the key name will be shown, not its value.

```bash
checkly env ls
```

### `npx checkly env add`

Add a global variable.

```bash
checkly env addKEY]VALUE]-l | -s] 
```

- `KEY`: Environment variable key.
- `VALUE`: Environment variable value.
- `--locked` or `-l`: Indicate that the environment variable will be locked, making it private to all read only users.
- `--secret` or `-s`: Indicate that the environment variable will be created as a secret. 

> Secrets are supported on version `40.90 and later.

### `npx checkly env update`

Update a global variable.

```bash
checkly env updateKEY] [VALUE] [-l | -s]
```

- `KEY`: Variable key.
- `VALUE`: Variable value.
- `--locked` or `-l`: Indicate that the variable will be locked, making it private to all read only users.
- `--secret` or `-s`: Indicate that the variable will be changed to a secret. Note that secrets cannot be changed to variables. When updating a secret always pass the `-s` flag.

> Secrets are supported on version `40.90 and later.

### `npx checkly env rm`

Remove a global variable.

```bash
checkly env rmKEY] [-f]
```

- `KEY`: Variable key.
