## `npx checkly deploy`

Deploys all your checks and associated resources like alert channels to your Checkly account.

### Usage Examples

Preview the differences between your actual configuration and your account:

```bash
npx checkly deploy --preview
```

Deploy all resources to your Checkly account:

```bash
npx checkly deploy
```

### Flags

- `--config` or `-c`: Specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--debug-bundle`: Generate a JSON file containing the data sent to our servers when you deploy.
- `--force` or `-f`: Skips the confirmation dialog when deploying. Handy in CI environments.
- `--preview` or `-p`: Preview the differences between your actual configuration and your account.
- `--output` or `-o`: Show applied differences after deploying.
- `--no-schedule-on-deploy`: Do not run checks when deploying.

When you deploy a project, you can attach Git specific information so changes to any resources are displayed in the Checkly web UI with the correct commit, owner, etc.

Some of the above variables will be detected automatically from your local or CI environment on a best effort basis.
