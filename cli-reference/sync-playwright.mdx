The `checkly sync-playwright` command synchronizes your Playwright configuration with your Checkly project configuration. This command copies relevant settings from your `playwright.config.ts` file into your `checkly.config.ts`, ensuring consistency between local testing and cloud monitoring.

## Usage

```bash
npx checkly sync-playwright
```

Copy Playwright configuration settings to your Checkly config.

## Extended Usage

```bash
npx checkly sync-playwright
```

Example process:
```bash
✓ Found playwright.config.ts
✓ Reading Playwright configuration...
✓ Merging with checkly.config.ts...
✓ Updated browser configuration
✓ Synchronized test timeouts
✓ Applied viewport settings
✓ Configuration sync completed
```

The command analyzes your Playwright configuration and updates relevant settings in your Checkly config file.

## Unique Options

This command has no unique options - it performs automatic configuration synchronization.

## Global Options

This command supports the following [global options](/cli-reference/global-options):

- [`--verbose`](/cli-reference/global-options#verbose-or-v) - Show detailed sync process information

## Configuration Sync

### Playwright Settings Synchronized

The sync process copies these settings from your Playwright config:

**Browser Configuration:**
- `use.browserName` → Browser selection for checks
- `use.headless` → Headless mode setting
- `use.viewport` → Default viewport size

**Timeout Settings:**
- `timeout` → Test execution timeout
- `expect.timeout` → Assertion timeout
- `use.actionTimeout` → Action timeout

**Network Configuration:**  
- `use.baseURL` → Base URL for relative navigation
- `use.httpCredentials` → HTTP authentication
- `use.ignoreHTTPSErrors` → SSL error handling

**Testing Behavior:**
- `use.screenshot` → Screenshot configuration
- `use.video` → Video recording settings
- `use.trace` → Tracing options

### Generated Checkly Configuration

After sync, your `checkly.config.ts` includes:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  projectName: 'My Project',
  // Synchronized from Playwright config
  browserChecks: {
    frequency: 300,
    locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
    tags: ['browser', 'production'],
    playwrightConfig: {
      use: {
        headless: true,
        viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
        actionTimeout: 30000,
        navigationTimeout: 30000,
      },
    },
  },
  // ... other configuration
})
```

## Prerequisites

### Required Files
- **Playwright config**: `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js`
- **Checkly config**: `checkly.config.ts` or `checkly.config.js`

### Project Structure
The sync command expects both configuration files in the same directory or follows standard project structure conventions.

## Sync Process

### 1. Configuration Discovery
```bash
npx checkly sync-playwright
# Searches for playwright.config.ts/js
# Locates checkly.config.ts/js
```

### 2. Setting Analysis
The command analyzes Playwright settings and determines which are relevant for Checkly monitoring.

### 3. Configuration Update  
Relevant settings are merged into your Checkly configuration, preserving existing Checkly-specific settings.

### 4. Validation
The updated configuration is validated for compatibility and consistency.

## Use Cases

### Initial Setup
Sync configurations when setting up monitoring for existing Playwright tests:
```bash
# After creating checkly.config.ts
npx checkly sync-playwright
npx checkly test
```

### Configuration Maintenance
Keep configurations in sync after updating Playwright settings:
```bash
# After updating playwright.config.ts
npx checkly sync-playwright
npx checkly deploy --preview
```

### Team Consistency
Ensure all team members use consistent browser and timeout settings:
```bash
# In CI/CD or team setup scripts
npx checkly sync-playwright
npx checkly test --record
```

## Best Practices

### Before Syncing
1. **Review Playwright config** for production-appropriate settings
2. **Backup Checkly config** to preserve custom configurations
3. **Test locally** with Playwright to verify settings work

### After Syncing
1. **Review merged config** for accuracy and conflicts
2. **Test with Checkly** to verify settings work in cloud environment
3. **Commit changes** to version control
4. **Deploy with preview** to verify production behavior

### Configuration Strategy
1. **Use Playwright config as source of truth** for browser settings
2. **Keep Checkly-specific settings** separate from Playwright config
3. **Sync regularly** to maintain consistency
4. **Document custom overrides** that shouldn't be synced

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration File Not Found
Ensure both `playwright.config.ts` and `checkly.config.ts` exist in your project.

### Sync Conflicts
Review merged configuration carefully - some settings may need manual adjustment.

### Browser Compatibility
Verify that Playwright settings are compatible with Checkly's runtime environment.

## Manual Configuration

If automatic sync doesn't meet your needs, you can manually configure browser settings in your `checkly.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  browserChecks: {
    playwrightConfig: {
      use: {
        // Custom browser configuration
        viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
        userAgent: 'Custom User Agent',
        // ... other settings
      },
    },
  },
})
```
