## `npx checkly test`

Executes all the checks in the scope of your project on the Checkly cloud infrastructure. You can specify files to run by appending a pattern, e.g. `npx checkly test home.spec.js api`.

### Usage Examples

Dry run all checks in your repo:

```bash
npx checkly test
```

Dry run checks that have `product` and `api` in the file name:

```bash
npx checkly test product api
```

Record a test session in Checkly with git branch info, full logging, videos and traces:

```bash
npx checkly test --record
```

Dry run all checks against a specific location:

```bash
npx checkly test --location eu-west-1
```

Dry run checks while passing a specific URL and a password. These variables are available on `process.env`:

```bash
npx checkly test --env ENVIRONMENT_URL="https://preview.acme.com" --env PASSWORD=doremiabc123
```

This is very powerful when combined with passing environment variables using one of the flags `--env` or `--env-file` as you can target staging, test and preview environment with specific URLs, credentials and other common variables that differ between environments.

### Flags

- `--config` or `-c`: Specify a particular configuration file, e.g. `--config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"`
- `--env <key=value>` or `-e`: Pass environment variables to the check execution runtime. Passed variables overwrite any existing variables stored in your Checkly account.
- `--env-file`: Read variables from a `.env` file by passing the file path, e.g. `--env-file="./.env"`
- `--grep <pattern>` or `-g`: Only run checks where the check name matches a regular expression.
- `--list`: Just list the checks in your project, but don't run them.
- `--location <location>` or `-l`: Run checks against a specified location, e.g. `eu-west-1`. Defaults to `us-east-1`.
- `--private-location <private location ID>`: Run checks against the specified private location.
- `--record`: Record tests results in Checkly as a test session.
- `--reporter` or `-r`: One or more reporters for the test output. Options are: `list|dot|ci|github|json`. You can use multiple reporters by specifying the flag multiple times, e.g. `--reporter=list --reporter=json`.
- `--tags` or `-t`: Filter the checks using a comma separated list of tags. Checks will only be run if they contain all the specified tags. Multiple `--tags` flags can be passed, in which case checks will be run if they match any of the `--tags` filters, i.e. `--tags production,webapp --tags staging,backend` will run checks with tags (production AND webapp) OR (staging AND backend).
- `--retries`: How many times to retry a failing check run. 0 by default and maximum 3.
- `--timeout`: A fallback timeout (in seconds) to wait for checks to complete. 600 seconds by default.
- `--update-snapshots` or `-u`: Update the golden images / reference snapshots of your visual comparison and snapshot tests.
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Always show the full logs of the checks.
